    <h1>About the Koda </h1>
    <div id="introduction"><h2>My project is an interactive beach! By interacting with it, Koda's beach goal is help help individuals relax and have fun! <br></br> When the mouse is clicked, users are able to interact with the sand and move sand kernals around. <br></br> When , the key "c" is pressed, users will be able to hold a sand castle while interacting with the beach! <br></br> If you just wanna look and not touch, no worries, the calming waves continously move, creating quite the theraputic visual.<br></br> Hope you enjoy Koda Beach! For anymore information on the inner workings of the beach feel free to visit <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/irene985/sketches/jlwb4l1xh"> my code</a> on p5js for more info~</div>
